## Introduction  
Homebase by Hive is a self-contained home monitoring system that records temperature, light, motion, and noise. It has a self-contained web server application built by [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a NoSQL database by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), and a mobile-friendly GUI by [OnsenUI](https://onsen.io) with charts by [Chart.js](www.chartjs.org).  
This project was created as a group class assignment in Spring 2017 for EECS113: Processor HW/SW Interfaces
